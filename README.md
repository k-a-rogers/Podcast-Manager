# Podcast-Manager
A tool to manage podcasts. This is a set of functions I wrote to manage podcast downloads for myself - I use inexpensive standalone music players rather than a smartphone for music & podcast listening, and this seemed something I could easily do for myself.

It's a simple tool but the goal is to create something that requires a minimum of interaction; I'll be continuing some further development towards that.
